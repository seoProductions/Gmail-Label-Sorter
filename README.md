# Gmail-Label-Sorter

Gmail allows you to add the "+" symbol followed by a word at the end of your email adress. This is so you can have multiple email adresses that all come into the same inbox.

### For Example: 
- johndoe+shop@gmail.com
- johndoe+work@gmail.com
- johndoe+school@gmail.com

### The problem:

Inorder to sort and filter each adress from one another, one has to manual create labels and tediously assign each adress to its coresponding label.

### Solution!

Written in Javascript, this script will automatically run every hour and sort each adresses into different labels accordingly.
All incomming emails without the "+" symbol will be left alone.

### TADA! Each email adress is automatically labeled!

### A bit of Context
Unfortunatley, their is no easy way (that I know of) for me to freely distribute this script as an add-on or extention. Implimenting it involves creating an account on [AppsScript](https://www.google.com/script/start/), creating a project, copying over the code, and deploying it onto your google account.. ect.

Puting all this aside, this script has proved very usefull to me thought the years, and I ultimatley felt worthy of publishing it on my github page.
