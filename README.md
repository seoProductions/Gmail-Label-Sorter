# Gmail-Label-Sorter
Gmail allows you to add the "+" symbol followed by a word at the end of your email adress. This is so you can have multiple email adresses that all come into the same inbox.

### For Example: 
- johndoe+shop@gmail.com
- johndoe+work@gmail.com
- johndoe+school@gmail.com

This script will automatically sort each adresses into different labels accordingly, and all
incomming emails without the "+" symbol will be left alone.
